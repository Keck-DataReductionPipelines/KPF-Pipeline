KPF Calibration-Masters Data Format
===============

Overview
--------

KPF master calibration-file products, made by combining similar subsets of input L0 image data,
are defined for these data levels:

* **2D**: Assembled CCD images with minimal processing.
* **Level 1 (L1)**: Extracted, wavelength-calibrated spectra
* **Level 2 (L2)**: Derived data products

Derived data products for L2 include cross-correlation functions, radial velocities, and activity indicators.
Each of these data levels has associated product files in a standardized, multi-extension FITS format
(with a few exceptions), and can be read using standard fits tools
(e.g., `astropy.fits.io <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/>`_)
and the `KPF-Pipeline <https://github.com/Keck-DataReductionPipelines/KPF-Pipeline>`_.

Master calibration files are generated daily, for each observation date.
The canonical location for persisted master files on the shrek machine is::

    /data/kpf/masters/<yyyymmdd>

Less frequently, the masters for some or all observation dates are reprocessed to
fix bugs, correct processing abnormalities, or incorporate new features.

The file-naming convention for 2D master calibration files generally adheres to the following prototype::

    kpf_<yyymmdd>_master_<type>_<object>.fits

where ``<yyyymmdd>`` is the observation date, and there is no explicit '_2D' suffix.
Master ``<type>`` can be either bias, dark, flat, arclamp, smooth lamp, and WLS.
Order-trace products unfortunately do not include anything like 'order_trace' in the filename
(please see below for more information).
Some master filenames include '_GREEN' or '_RED' as suffixes before
the '.fits' filename extension to indicate that they pertain to that specific filter only.
Master ``<object>`` in the file-naming scheme is a descriptive hyphenated subtype string
(derived from the OBJECT FITS keyword of a representation input data L0 FITS file), and
can be like any of the examples listed in the following table (the list is not exhaustive, but
gives the reader an idea of what to expect)::

    autocal-bias
    autocal-dark
    (none for master flat)
    (none for master smooth lamp)
    autocal-une-all-morn
    autocal-une-cal-eve
    autocal-une-sci-eve
    autocal-une-sky-eve
    autocal-une-all-eve
    slewcal
    autocal-etalon-all-eve
    autocal-etalon-all-midday
    autocal-etalon-all-morn
    autocal-etalon-all-night
    autocal-lfc-all-eve
    autocal-lfc-all-midnight
    autocal-lfc-all-morn
    autocal-thar-all-eve
    autocal-thar-all-morn
    autocal-thar-cal-eve
    autocal-thar-sci-eve
    autocal-thar-sky-eve

The master flat and smooth-lamp filenames do not include the ``<object>`` placeholder by quirk of the software.

The L1 and L2 master files have similar file names, but with '_L1', or '_L2' suffixes before the '.fits' filename extension.

There are four exceptions to this general file-naming scheme, namely:

*  The 2D (no explicit suffix), L1, and L2 master-flat products have filenames like the following (no ``<object>`` placeholder)::

    kpf_<yyyymmdd>_master_flat.fits
    kpf_<yyyymmdd>_master_flat_L1.fits
    kpf_<yyyymmdd>_master_flat_L2.fits

*  The 2D (no explicit suffix), L1, and L2 smooth-lamp products have filenames like the following (no explicit '_master' and no ``<object>`` placeholder)::

    kpf_<yyyymmdd>_smooth_lamp.fits
    kpf_<yyyymmdd>_smooth_lamp_L1.fits
    kpf_<yyyymmdd>_smooth_lamp_L2.fits

*  The order-trace products have filenames like the following (CSV files instead of FITS, and explicit filter suffix is included)::

    kpf_<yyyymmdd>_master_flat_GREEN_CCD.csv
    kpf_<yyyymmdd>_master_flat_RED_CCD.csv

* The etalon wavelength masks have filenames like the following (CSV files instead of FITS, and in the masks subdirectory, with derived ``<object>`` placeholder broken down by fiber)::

    masks/<yyyymmdd>_eve_CAL_etalon_wavelengths.csv
    masks/<yyyymmdd>_eve_SCI1_etalon_wavelengths.csv
    masks/<yyyymmdd>_eve_SCI2_etalon_wavelengths.csv
    masks/<yyyymmdd>_eve_SCI3_etalon_wavelengths.csv
    masks/<yyyymmdd>_morn_CAL_etalon_wavelengths.csv

Data Format of KPF Master Files
-------------------------------

Master Bias
^^^^^^^^^^^

A 2D master-bias file is a pixel-by-pixel clipped mean of a stack of L0 FITS image-data frames with
``IMTYPE='Bias'`` and ``OBJECT='autocal-bias'`` observed on the same date.

Here are the FITS extensions of interest in a 2D master-bias file:

It includes useful metadata about the image stacking, including the specific input flat L0 FITS files.
The input flat L0 FITS files are preprocessed to subtract the overscan biases, assemble the CCD images, subtract
the master bias, and subtract the master dark.  The header keyword ``INPBIAS`` gives the master bias employed.
The header keyword ``INPDARK`` gives the master dark employed.  As can be seen, a relatively large number of
frames are stacked in this example.

Two important master files that are required as inputs to the generation of a master flat are
the master order mask and the master smooth lamp.  Normally these files are only updated when instrument
characteristics change.  These are given by the ``ORDRMASK`` and ``LAMPPATT`` FITS-header keywords, and are discussed in more
detail in sections that follow.  These two relatively static files are kept in the
``/data/kpf/reference_fits`` directory on the shrek machine.


Master Smooth Lamp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new 2D master smooth lamp is made daily from the data taken on the corresponding observation date
for reference purposes (in ``/data/kpf/masters/<yyyymmdd>`` on the shrek machine), but the master smooth
lamp that is used to create a master flat is relatively static and only updated when the flat-lamp or
instrument characteristics change (say, on the time scale of months).

The smoothing is done using a sliding-window kernel 200-pixels wide (along dispersion dimension)
by 1-pixel high (along cross-dispersion dimension) by computing the clipped mean
with 3-sigma double-sided outlier rejection.   The fixed smooth lamp pattern
normalizes the flat field and enables the flat-field
correction to remove the effects of pixel-detector responsivity variations along with
dust and debris signatures on the optics of the instrument and telescope.

Here are the only two FITS extensions of interest in a 2D master-smooth-lamp file:

===================  =========  ==============  ==============  ========================================================
Extension Name       Data Type  Data Dimension  Data Units      Description
===================  =========  ==============  ==============  ========================================================
GREEN_CCD            image      4080 x 4080     electrons/sec   Master order smooth lamp pattern for GREEN
RED_CCD              image      4080 x 4080     electrons/sec   Master order smooth lamp pattern for RED
===================  =========  ==============  ==============  ========================================================



Master Order Mask and Trace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A 2D master order mask FITS file contains GREEN and RED mask images showing the locations of the
diffraction orderlet traces in the image data.
The order-mask values are numbered from 1 to 5 designating distinct orderlet traces from
bottom to top in the image, so as to differentiate the corresponding fiber of the orderlet trace
(sky, sci1, sci2, sci3, cal).
An order-mask value of zero indicates the mask pixel is not on any order trace in the mask.
The following table summarizes the possible order-mask values at various pixel locations in the mask:

=========================  =================
Fiber of Orderlet Trace    Order Mask Value

Generally, the master order mask is relatively static and updated via computation from
master order-trace files for GREEN and RED only periodically (a new one is not made daily).
New master order-trace files for GREEN and RED are made daily from the data taken on the
corresponding observation date for reference purposes (in ``/data/kpf/masters/<yyyymmdd>`` on the shrek machine),
but these are only used to create a new master order mask for the generation of daily master flats
when the instrument characteristics change (say, on the time scale of months).

Master order-trace files, such as ``kpf_20250122_master_flat_GREEN_CCD.csv`` and
``kpf_20250122_master_flat_RED_CCD.csv``, are CSV files containing the following quantites
for each diffraction order:
Coeff0, Coeff1, Coeff2, Coeff3, BottomEdge, TopEdge, X1, X2.
This information is used to compute the location and curvature of the orderlet traces in the image data.

Here are the only two FITS extensions of interest in a 2D master-order-mask file:

===================  =========  ==============  ==============  ========================================================
Extension Name       Data Type  Data Dimension  Data Units      Description
===================  =========  ==============  ==============  ========================================================
GREEN_CCD            image      4080 x 4080     Dimensionless   Master order mask image for GREEN
RED_CCD              image      4080 x 4080     Dimensionless   Master order mask image for RED

Master Arclamp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A 2D master-arclamp file is a pixel-by-pixel clipped mean of a stack of L0 FITS image-data frames with
``IMTYPE='Arclamp'`` and the same ``OBJECT`` keyword string observed on the same date.

Here are the FITS extensions of interest in a 2D master-arclamp file:

===================  =========  ==============  ==============  ========================================================
Extension Name       Data Type  Data Dimension  Data Units      Description
===================  =========  ==============  ==============  ========================================================

RED_CCD              image      4080 x 4080     electrons       Master arclamp image for RED
GREEN_CCD_UNC        image      4080 x 4080     electrons       Master arclamp-image uncertainty for GREEN
GREEN_CCD_CNT        image      4080 x 4080     count           Master arclamp-image number of stack samples for GREEN
RED_CCD_UNC          image      4080 x 4080     electrons       Master arclamp-image uncertainty for RED
RED_CCD_CNT          image      4080 x 4080     count           Master arclamp-image number of stack samples for RED

It includes useful metadata about the image stacking, including the specific input arclamp L0 FITS files.
The input arclamp L0 FITS files are preprocessed to subtract the overscan biases, assemble the CCD images,
subtract the master bias, subtract the master dark, and apply the master flat.
The header keyword ``INPBIAS`` gives the master bias employed.
The header keyword ``INPDARK`` gives the master dark employed.
The header keyword ``INPFLAT`` gives the master flat employed.
