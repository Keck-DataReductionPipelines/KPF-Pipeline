Basics of CCD Raw Spectral Data
-----------------

A CCD (charged-coupled device) is a sensor of many pixels that allows
photons to be detected and a digital image to be produced.
The CCD is exposed to light for a certain amount of requested time,
called exposure time (e.g., EXPTIME in the FITS PRIMARY header, in seconds).
In the case of spectral imaging, the light from a source of interest is captured
in a digital image by the spectrometer CCD, and this image is called a raw 2D echellogram.
KPF spectroscopic-image data are taken by CCDs with GREEN and RED filters
(and a separate CCD with a Ca H&K line filter),
and these are exposed simultaneously via a beamsplitter.
CCD data are read out in parallel by different amplifiers into CCD subimages.
The raw spectral data from a single exposure are formatted into
a single computer data file in standardized, multi-extension FITS format.
There are multiple image extensions to contain the 2D subimage data from different readout amplifiers and filters,
as well as table extensions for exposure metadata and ancillary information.
This is called an L0 FITS file.   An example FITS filename for KPF is ``KP.20221203.81416.24.fits``,
which is an arclamp calibration exposure, and the observation date and time are embedded in the filename.

Generally, the spectral wavelength range covered in the data extends from the blue portion
of the spectral range at bottom of the image to the red portion of the spectral range
at the top of the image.  The spectral wavelength also increases monotonically from
left to right in the image.  Light from a given instrument fiber-optic cable will show up in the image
as a slightly curved horizontal swath of 10 or 20 pixels in width that covers much of the
image from left to right, called an 'orderlet trace', which will appear to repeat vertically in the image
as different spectral wavelength ranges are traversed and detected (but with independent spectral data
content), an effect of the diffraction grating and optics that direct how
light is spread out onto the CCD by different diffraction orders.
Thus, a given order trace, which is a group of orderlet traces from a bundle of fibers (more detail below),
will have a wavelength range that somewhat overlaps
those of the neighboring order traces below and above.
This complexity makes the reduction of 2D raw spectra data particularly challenging.

The following figure is a small section of a subimage of the aforementioned arclamp exposure from the ``GREEN-AMP1``
FITS image extension near the right side of the CCD associated with the corresponding readout amplifier.

.. image:: KP.20221203.81416.24_subimage.png

This figure, shown above, is about 500 pixels wide, zoomed in to highlight features in the data.
It shows portions of three sets of order traces horizontally oriented,
where each order trace is composed of 5 distinct orderlets from top to bottom
made by the ``CAL``, ``SCI3``, ``SCI2``, ``SCI1``, and ``SKY`` fibers of the instrument.
Atomic lines from the arc lamp are clearly visible in the orderlets.  There are gaps between
orderlet traces within the same order, and larger gaps between order-trace bundles.

This is further illustrated in the following diagram, which shows spectral orders
and the arrangement of orderlets within each order.
The horizontal axis in the diagram is actually the vertical axis of a CCD spectral data image, and the
left arrow beside the Pixel Number label on the horizontal axis points toward the top of the image.

.. image:: orderlet_diagram_2d.png

The order numbers in the diagram are spectral order numbers that obey the grating equation
(and not array indices that start at zero).
The orderlet ordering is ``CAL``, ``SCI3``, ``SCI2``, ``SCI1``, and ``SKY``,
starting at the top of the 2D spectral data image,
as is usual for viewing images with image-viewing software, with redder orders above and bluer orders below.
Note that in the bluest order (at the right edge of the diagram or bottom of the 2D spectral data image),
the SKY trace partially falls off of the active area of the CCD, so it is not shown at that particular
place in the above diagram.


CCD Image Processing
--------------------

The CCD image processing consists of several steps, as discussed below.
It starts with an L0 FITS file for a given exposure and ends with a 2D FITS file.
The L0 FITS file contains several HDUs (header-data units) with CCD subimage data from
separate readout amplifiers.
The size in pixels of the subimages depends on the mode in which the instrument operating,
which may be utilizing 2 or 4 amplifiers for a given GREEN or RED filter.
For example, with 2 amplifiers the subimage is 2094x4110 pixels.
The description in this section mainly refers to the GREEN and RED CCDs.

Here are the basic image-processing steps for a given L0 FITS file:

1. Overscan subtraction
2. Mosaicing amplifier subimage data into a full image.
3. Master bias subtraction
4. Master dark subtraction
5. Master flat correction
6. Quality control testing
7. Production of a 2D FITS file for the exposure

Overscan subtraction is a fundamental data-reduction step in CCD image processing.
It is the removal of the bias in the data that is associated
with signal from pixels that are not exposed to light.  By design, the edges of a CCD are masked
off so that there is no light exposure, and so sensor data from these overscan regions
(or so-called bias strips) can be used to compute the overscan bias.
Overscan subtraction is also known as "floating-bias subtraction", which is not to be confused with the
master bias subtraction to be discussed below.
The method of determining the overscan bias is, for a given readout amplifier, to compute the clipped mean of data
well into the overscan strip, avoiding the 4-pixel pre-scan region, with an addition 5-pixel buffer away from
the edges of the overscan strip.  The specific clipped-mean algorithm involves rejecting data that are
+/- some number of sigmas from the median of the data, where sigma is robustly computed by::

    sigma = 0.5 * (p84 - p16)
    p84 = 84th percentile of the data
    p16 = 16th percentile of the data

The mean or average is computed from the remaining data.
The level of data clipping is 2.1 sigma.
The overscan bias, which is just a number for each readout amplifier (for a given filter), is then subtracted from
the image data at each pixel in the unmasked or light-exposed portion of the CCD subimage data for that
readout amplifier.
The CCD subimage is trimmed to completely remove the bias strips that are now superfluous.
With the overscan bias removed, the CCD subimage data are a step closer to a regime that is
linearly proportional to the amount of light exposure.  The python module ``overscan_subtract.py``
under git repository ``KPF-Pipeline/modules/Utils`` handles both overscan subtraction and
mosaicing amplifier subimage data into a full image.  This module is called from subrecipe
``watchfor_kpf_l0.recipe`` of the KPF data reduction pipeline ``kpf_drp.recipe``
under git repository ``KPF-Pipeline/recipes``.  The ``WATCHFOR_L0`` block in configuration file
``kpf_drp.cfg`` under git repository ``KPF-Pipeline/configs`` gives the parameter settings used.

The mosaicing of subimages from different readout amplifiers into a full CCD image for a given filter (GREEN or RED)
is straightforward.  The relative positions of the subimages are described in the following parameter files under
git repository ``KPF-Pipeline/static``: ``kpfsim_ccd_orient_green.txt`` and ``kpfsim_ccd_orient_red.txt``.
At this point the product is in 2D FITS format, but the actual 2D FITS file is not actually written to disk
until after all the remaining CCD image processing has been done, which is described in the remainder of this section.

Next is master bias subtraction.  This is done in machine memory, continued after the aforementioned steps.
Whereas overscan subtraction involves subtracting off the floating bias specific to an exposure
(and readout amplifier), master bias subtraction involves the pixel-by-pixel subtraction of a
master bias image that is common to a collection of
exposures taken within some short period of time (such as 24 hours).  The master bias is a data-clipped,
pixel-by-pixel stack average of some number of bias frames that were taken in the near vicinity of time.
A database query is performed to obtain the nearest-in-time available master bias 2D FITS file (past or future).
The section below called **Master Files Creation** gives more details about the generation of master bias files.
FITS keyword ``BIASDONE = 1`` is written to the FITS header to signify that master bias subtraction was done.
If the input image is itself a bias exposure, then the pipeline does not perform master bias subtraction and
FITS keyword ``BIASDONE = 0`` will be written to the FITS header.
Regardless, the path and filename of the master bias file that was applied or would have been applied is
written to FITS keywords ``BIASDIR`` and ``BIASFILE``, respectively.

Master dark subtraction is done next, also in machine memory.  Dark current contributes electrons to the signal
of a pixel in proportion to time, and must be removed from the desired photon-detection signal.
From the input image to be processed,
master dark subtraction involves involves the pixel-by-pixel subtraction of a
master dark image, in electrons per second, multiplied by the exposure time of the input image.
The master dark is a data-clipped, pixel-by-pixel stack average of some number of dark frames,
normalized by their exposure times, that were taken in the near vicinity of time.
A database query is performed to obtain the nearest-in-time available master dark 2D FITS file.
The section below called **Master Files Creation** gives more details about the generation of master dark files.
FITS keyword ``DARKDONE = 1`` is written to the FITS header to signify that master dark subtraction was done.
If the input image is itself a bias or dark exposure, then the pipeline does not perform master dark subtraction and
FITS keyword ``DARKDONE = 0`` will be written to the FITS header.
Regardless, the path and filename of the master dark file that was applied or would have been applied is
written to FITS keywords ``DARKDIR`` and ``DARKFILE``, respectively.

Master flat correction is done next, also in machine memory.
This is also known as the image nonuniformity correction,
and it corrects for pixel-to-pixel variations in detector responsivity.
The input image is simply divided by the master flat.
The master flat is a data-clipped,
pixel-by-pixel stack average of some number of Flatlamp frames that were taken in the near vicinity of time.
A database query is performed to obtain the nearest-in-time available master flat 2D FITS file.
The section below called **Master Files Creation** gives more details about the generation of master flat files.
FITS keyword ``FLATDONE = 1`` is written to the FITS header to signify that master flat correction was done.
If the input image is itself a bias or dark exposure, then the pipeline does not perform master flat correction and
FITS keyword ``FLATDONE = 0`` will be written to the FITS header.
Regardless, the path and filename of the master flat file that was applied or would have been applied is
written to FITS keywords ``FLATDIR`` and ``FLATFILE``, respectively.

Quality control testing is also done. Below is a fairly complete example of all the FITS keywords that
are written to the PRIMARY header after successfully CCD image processing, with helpful keyword comments::

In the end, the 2D FITS file is written to the filesystem,
containing HDUs for GREEN and RED full spectroscopic-data images,
each 4080x4080 pixels, with FITS extension names ``GREEN_CCD`` and ``RED_CCD``, respectively.
The overscan biases that were subtracted are recorded in the FITS headers of
these HDUs (not PRIMARY HDU); for example::

    OSCANV1 =    3086.385215099043 / Overscan clipped mean (e-), GREEN_AMP1
    OSCANV2 =    2783.307279684444 / Overscan clipped mean (e-), GREEN_AMP2

The physical units of the image data is electrons.
There are also associated variance images with FITS extension names
``GREEN_VAR`` and ``RED_VAR``, respectively, with physical units of electrons squared.


Master Files Creation
---------------------

This section describes the algorithms for how master files are made for bias, dark, flat, LFC, etalon, and ThAr exposures.
Master files at the 2D data level are essentially pixel-by-pixel averages of many independent exposures of the same kind,
in order to beat down the noise.
There are bias, dark, and flat exposures that are stacked, as well as arclamp exposures for LFC, etalon, and ThAr.
The averaging actually involves computing a clipped mean after outliers are rejected, which lie outside the ``+/- N-sigma`` envelope
around the median of the data, where sigma is computed robustly from percentiles using the following formula based on the
standard deviation of normal data::

    sigma = 0.5 * (p84 - p16)
    p84 = 84th percentile of the data
    p16 = 16th percentile of the data

For each stack-average image, an uncertainty image is also computed, where the uncertainty at a
given pixel location is the square root of the quantity stack variance divided by number of stack samples
left after outlier rejection.
A correction factor is applied to properly reinflate the variance after it is naturally diminished via the data clipping.
The FrameStacker python class in ``modules.Utils.frame_stacker`` is common code to all image stacking used for KPF data,
and encompasses our methods for computing the average, variance, and other statistics.
The FitsHeaders python class in ``modules.Utils.kpf_fits`` includes methods for filtering file directories
to identify all exposure files for a given observation date that are inputs for the type of master file to be created.
The QC python class helper method called ``check_all_qc_keywords`` in ``modules.quality_control.src.quality_control`` is
utilized to check input-data QC-related FITS-header keywords, including ``NOTJUNK``, and skip images that do not pass
this very important QC checking.

Once the 2D-stacked-image master files are created, then L1 and then L2 versions of the master files are subsequently produced
by running the 2D master files through the standard KPF DRP as if they were single science exposures.
Master files are generated daily for each new observation date.

There are also derived versions of master files that do not necessarily involve image stacking (at least directly).
This includes smooth-lamp pattern 2D images and order-mask 2D images, and order-trace CSV files.  Only master order-mask files
are not generated daily.

Master Biases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A 2D master-bias file is a pixel-by-pixel clipped mean of a stack of L0 FITS image-data frames with
``IMTYPE='Bias'`` and ``OBJECT='autocal-bias'`` observed on the same date.
Each input L0 file is processed to perform overscan bias subtraction and assembly of subimages
from separate amplifiers for a given filter into a 2D image.
For the data clipping, ``N_sigma = 2.1`` is used.
The data units of a master bias 2D image in the ``GREEN_CCD`` or ``RED_CCD`` FITS extensions
of an output master bias file are electrons.
An example of a master bias file filename is ``kpf_20250122_master_bias_autocal-bias.fits``.

Master Darks
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A 2D master-dark file is a pixel-by-pixel clipped mean of a stack of L0 FITS image-data frames with
``IMTYPE='Dark'`` and ``OBJECT='autocal-dark'`` observed on the same date.
Each input L0 file is processed to perform overscan bias subtraction and assembly of subimages
from separate amplifiers for a given filter into a 2D image.
Input dark frames must have a minimum exposure time of 300 seconds.
Before the image stacking, the relevant master bias is subtracted and the resulting data
are normalized by input frame exposure time (FITS keyword ``EXPTIME``).
For the data clipping, ``N_sigma = 2.2`` is used.
The data units of a master dark 2D image in the ``GREEN_CCD`` or ``RED_CCD`` FITS extensions
of an output master dark file are electrons/second.
An example of a master dark filename is ``kpf_20250122_master_dark_autocal-dark.fits``.

Master Flats
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A 2D master-flat file is used to correct variations in pixel detector responsity, the so-called
nonuniformity correction.  Several complex steps are involved in computing a 2D master flat.
It is basically a pixel-by-pixel clipped mean of a stack of L0 FITS image-data frames with
``IMTYPE='Flatlamp'``, ``OBJECT='autocal-flat-all'``, and ``EXPTIME`` less than or equal to 60 seconds
observed on the same date, appropriately normalized as described below to "flatten" the master flat.
Each input L0 file is processed to perform overscan bias subtraction and assembly of subimages
from separate amplifiers for a given filter into a 2D image.
Before the image stacking, the relevant master bias is subtracted and the resulting data
are normalized by input frame exposure time (FITS keyword ``EXPTIME``), and the relevant master dark
is then subtracted.
For the data clipping, ``N_sigma = 2.3`` is used.
The data units of a flat-field 2D image in the ``GREEN_CCD`` or ``RED_CCD`` FITS extensions
of an output master flat file are dimensionless.  Other image FITS extensions in the 2D master flat
are written for the uncertainties, sample counts, unnormalized stack average, and smooth lamp pattern
(see :doc:`KPF Calibration-Masters Data Format </info/masters_format>` ).
An example of a 2D master flat filename is ``kpf_20250123_master_flat.fits``.

The heart of the master-flat algorithm for the GREEN and RED CCDs involves separate
normalization of the unnormalized stack-averaged flat for each orderlet trace.
The following is the pertinent Python code,
and note that the very important step of normalizing by the master smooth lamp is
first done to remove the low-frequency intensity variations in the ``Flatlamp`` stack image
(the smooth lamp pattern is discussed in detail in a separate section below)::


    unnormalized_flat = stack_avg / smooth_lamp_pattern
    unnormalized_flat_unc = stack_unc / smooth_lamp_pattern

    # Apply order mask, if available for the current FITS extension.

    np_om_ffi = np.array(np.rint(order_mask_data[ffi])).astype(int)   # Ensure rounding to nearest integer.
    np_om_ffi_shape = np.shape(np_om_ffi)
    order_mask_n_dims = len(np_om_ffi_shape)

    if order_mask_n_dims == 2:      # Check if valid data extension

        # Loop over 5 orderlets in the KPF instrument and normalize separately for each.

        flat = unnormalized_flat
        flat_unc = unnormalized_flat_unc

        # Order mask has orderlets numbered from 1 to 5 (bottom to top).
        # Order mask value is zero if not on any orderlet trace.

        for orderlet_val in range(1,6):
            np_om_ffi_bool = np.where(np_om_ffi == orderlet_val,True,False)
            np_om_ffi_bool = np.where(stack_avg > self.low_light_limit,np_om_ffi_bool,False)

            # Invert mask for numpy.ma operation.
            unmx = ma.masked_array(unnormalized_flat, mask = ~ np_om_ffi_bool)

            # Compute mode of distribution for normalization factor.
            vals_for_mode_calc = np.where(np_om_ffi == orderlet_val,np.rint(100.0 * unnormalized_flat),np.nan)
            vals_for_mode_calc = np.where(stack_avg > self.low_light_limit,vals_for_mode_calc,np.nan)
            mode_vals,mode_counts = mode(vals_for_mode_calc,axis=None,nan_policy='omit')

            normalization_factor = mode_vals[0] / 100.0      # Divide by 100 to account for above binning.

            flat = np.where(np_om_ffi_bool == True, flat / normalization_factor, flat)
            flat_unc = np.where(np_om_ffi_bool == True, flat_unc / normalization_factor, flat_unc)

.. note::
    The master smooth lamp that is used to create a 2D master flat is relatively static and only updated
    when the flat-lamp or instrument characteristics change (say, on the time scale of months).


Master flat values are forced to be 1.0 for pixels with an order mask value of zero.  Order masks
are described in greater detail below.
Also, master flat values are forced to be 1.0 for pixels with stack-average values
that are less than the current low_light_limit of 5.01 electrons per second.
Resetting a master flat value to 1.0 is the safest way to deal with pixels for which it is
difficult or impossible to compute a nonuniformity correction.


Master Smooth Lamp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new 2D master smooth lamp is made daily from the data taken on the corresponding observation date
for reference purposes (in ``/data/kpf/masters/<yyyymmdd>`` on the shrek machine), but the master smooth
lamp that is used to create a 2D master flat is relatively static and only updated when the flat-lamp or
instrument characteristics change (say, on the time scale of months).

The inputs are stacked Flatlamp 2D images from the ``GREEN_CCD_STACK`` and ``RED_CCD_STACK`` FITS extensions
of a master-flat file.  The data units of the inputs are electrons per second.
The smoothing is done using a sliding-window kernel 200-pixels wide (along dispersion dimension)
by 1-pixel high (along cross-dispersion dimension) by computing the clipped mean
with 3-sigma double-sided outlier rejection.
The data units of output master smooth-lamp images are electrons/second.

The fixed smooth lamp pattern is used by the master-flat pipeline specifically
to normalize the flat field and remove low-frequency variations in the master flat.
It is important to use an updated smooth lamp pattern when the intensity shape in Flatlamp exposures
changes substantially in the KPF instrument.

Master Order Trace and Mask
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Master order-trace files, such as ``kpf_20250122_master_flat_GREEN_CCD.csv`` and
``kpf_20250122_master_flat_RED_CCD.csv``, are CSV files containing the following quantites
for each diffraction order:
Coeff0, Coeff1, Coeff2, Coeff3, BottomEdge, TopEdge, X1, X2.
This information is used to compute the location and curvature of the orderlet traces in the image data.

From the order-trace files, a 2D master order mask FITS file containing GREEN and RED mask images that
show locations of the diffraction orderlet traces in the image data can be computed.
The order-mask values are numbered from 1 to 5 designating distinct orderlet traces from
bottom to top in the image, so as to differentiate the corresponding fiber of the orderlet trace
(sky, sci1, sci2, sci3, cal).
An order-mask value of zero indicates the mask pixel is not on any order trace in the mask.
The following table summarizes the possible order-mask values at various pixel locations in the mask:

=========================  =================
Fiber of Orderlet Trace    Order Mask Value
=========================  =================
None                               0
SKY                                1
SCI1                               2
SCI2                               3
SCI3                               4
CAL                                5
=========================  =================

Generally, the master order mask is relatively static and updated via computation from
master order-trace files for GREEN and RED only periodically (a new order-mask file is not made daily,
but new order-trace files are made daily).
New master order-trace files for GREEN and RED are made daily from the data taken on the
corresponding observation date for reference purposes (in ``/data/kpf/masters/<yyyymmdd>`` on the shrek machine),
but these are only used to create a new master order mask for the generation of daily master flats
when the instrument characteristics change (say, on the time scale of months).

Master Arclamps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A 2D master-arclamp file is a pixel-by-pixel clipped mean of a stack of L0 FITS image-data frames with
``IMTYPE='Arclamp'`` and the same ``OBJECT`` keyword string observed on the same date.
Each input L0 file is processed to perform overscan bias subtraction and assembly of subimages
from separate amplifiers for a given filter into a 2D image.
For the data clipping, ``N_sigma = 2.4`` is used.
The data units of a master arclamp 2D image in the ``GREEN_CCD`` or ``RED_CCD`` FITS extensions
of an output master arclamp file are electrons.
An example of a master arclamp filename is ``kpf_20250122_master_arclamp_autocal-thar-cal-eve.fits``.

Stellar Activity Information
----------------------------
KPF does not yet have stellar activity indicators produced as a standard data product from the DRP.  The Ca H & K spectrometer covers the Ca H & K lines and we expect the DRP to produce S-values on the Mt. Wilson scale.  Future DRP developments are also expected to include code to generate other activity indicators (Ca IR triplet, Hα, etc.)

Guider Data Processing
----------------------
The DRP does not further process the data from the KPF Guider that are stored in FITS extensions in the L0 files.  These data include a guider image summed over the spectrometer integration and a table of guiding corrections, flux measurements, and other diagnostics taken from real-time Source Extractor analysis of the guider frames (typically at 100 Hz speed).
