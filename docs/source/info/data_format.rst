KPF Data Format
===============

Overview
--------

KPF data products are defined for these data levels:

* **Level 0 (L0)**: Raw data products produced by KPF at the W. M. Keck Observatory
* **2D**: Assembled CCD images with minimal processing.  This data product is produced by the DRP during processing from L0 to L1 but is not fundamental and is frequently not archived.
* **Level 1 (L1)**: Extracted, wavelength-calibrated spectra
* **Level 2 (L2)**: Derived data products including cross-correlation functions, radial velocities, and activity indicators.

Each of these data levels is a standardized, multi-extension FITS format, and can be read using standard fits tools (e.g., `astropy.fits.io <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/io/fits/>`_) and the `KPF-Pipeline <https://github.com/Keck-DataReductionPipelines/KPF-Pipeline>`_.

KPF L0 files follow the naming convention: KP.YYYYMMDD.SSSSS.ss.fits, where YYYYMMDD is a date and SSSSS.ss is the number of decimal seconds after UT midnight corresponding to the start of the exposure.  2D/L1/L2 files have similar file names, but with '_2D', '_L1', or '_L2' before '.fits'.  For example, KP.YYYYMMDD.SSSSS.ss_2D.fits is a 2D file name.

See the section titled :ref:`label-tutorials` for a set of tutorials on the various KPF data files.

In addition, the DRP is able to produce WLS Dictionaries that contain detailed diagnostic information about the fits of individual lines, orders, and orderlets for the wavelength solutions.  These are described at the bottom of this page.

[a] - the example shown above is for two-amplifier mode.  When KPF is operated in fast' read mode, four amplifiers per CCD will be used and there will be a corresponding number of AMP extensions.

========  ==========================================  =========

Keywords related to read noise are only computed for the amplifiers used.  In regular read mode, two amplifiers are used (AMP1 and AMP2), while in fast read mode, four amplifiers are used (AMP1, AMP2, AMP3, and AMP4).

Keywords related to dark current (starting with FLX) are only added for 2D files of Dark observations (no illumination and exposure time > 0). The regions for those keywords refer to the CCD coordinates where the dark current measurements were made (using modules/quicklook/arc/analyze_2d.py).  The image below (click to enlarge) shows the regions and dark current estimates for a 2D spectrum taken when the dark current was high.

Keywords related to the Guider are only added for 2D files that have Guider data products.  Similar for Exposure Meter data products.

Keywords related to L0 amplifier-image statistics (e.g., MEDGRN1) are only added to 2D files.  A robust estimator of data dispersion width is
sigma = 0.5 * (P84 - P16), equivalent to one standard deviation for normally distributed data.

The keywords above related to the signal-to-noise ratio in L1 spectra all start with 'SNR'.  These measurements were made using modules/quicklook/src/analyze_l1.py.  The image below (click to enlarge) shows the spectral orders and wavelengths at which SNR is measured.

Keywords related to flux ratios between orders (FR452652, FR548652, FR747652, FR852652) are the ratios between the 95th percentile in flux for the spectral orders containing 452 nm, 548 nm, 747 nm, and 852 nm, all normalized by the spectral order containing 652 nm.  These are the same spectral orders used for the SNR calculations and use the SCI2 orderlet.

Keywords related to orderlet flux ratios (e.g., FR12M452 and its uncertainty FR12U452) are computed in 500-pixel regions in the centers in the same spectral orders as are used for the SNR calculations.

L2 RV Extension Header
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The header to the RV extension (not the primary extension) contains this information about RVs computed using the CCF technique. CCD1 refers to the Green CCD (445-600 nm) and CCD2 refers to the Red CCD (600-870 nm).

To-do, add notes on: 

- recommendations for which RVs to use in papers
- how the orders are averaged using weights.  
- precisely how the RVs are computed (refer to a paper on the CCF algorithm that we're using)
- how the errors are computed
- is BJD = BJD :sub:`TBD`? 
- Test equation for rst syntax: :math:`y = x^2`

L2 RV Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The RV extension in an L2 file contains the order-by-order RV information for each orderlet (SCI1, SCI2, SCI3, CAL, SKY) determined by the CCF technique.  This extension is a FITS table that is converted into a Pandas dataframe if the L2 file is read by `kpfpipe.models.level2.KPF2.from_fits()`.  The table rows correspond to the spectral orders, with the values of the keywords `CCD1ROW` and `CCD2ROW` in the RV extension header giving the rows where the Green and Red orders start, respectively.  The table columns are listed below.

Notes on Dates and Times in KPF Files
-------------------------------------
* To do: add notes here about how DATE-BEG, DATE-MID, and DATE-END are computed.  There are other datetimes in the header that should be clarified.  Also, explain how exposure midpoints are computed (using the exposure meter and DATE-BEG??), which leads to BJD and ultimately the barycentric corrections.
